            <p>Hello there! My name is Liam Condon, a current student of UC Berkeley Bootcamp's Full Stack Flex program, and aspiring software engineer. After graduating the University of Vermont in 2016 with a B.A. in both Economics and Environmental Studies, I spent a few years working as a Business Analyst for a Solar energy Developer in the greater NYC area. I very much enjoyed working in the Renewable Energy industry, and after being exposed briefly through my job to the joys and possibilities of software development, I decided to take a leave of absence to further my skills in these areas.</p>

            <p class= "aboutme">Upon completion of this program, I will be well versed in both Front End (Javascript) and Back End (Node.js) frameworks, as well as in MySQL, React, HTML & CSS and several other technologies.</p>

            <p class= "aboutme">In the summer of 2018, I quit my job and rode my bicycle solo from Washington D.C. to Seattle, WA. It was an incredible experience that I'm so grateful I was able to have! Please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> if you'd like to chat about my experience and/or my skills and capabilities as a developer. I look forward to hearing from you!</p>
