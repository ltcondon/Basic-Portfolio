# Liam Condon - A Basic Portfolio

![portfolio screenshot](assets/images/portfolio-screenshot.png)

This portfolio is one composed of html and css built from scratch. It will serve as a starting point upon which I can add and showcase my future work.

## Layout

The Portfolio is laid out across three pages, 'About' (also the home page or 'index'), 'Portfolio', and 'Contact'. Each page has it's own distinct .html page, but all three refer to one CSS sheet. 

Each page contains a navigation bar with a header (my name) and a footer (basic copyright info).

### Content

The 'About' page contains basic education and personal information about myself and my experience, as well as a professional headshot.

The 'Portfolio' page contains six placeholder images for projects that are to be built.

The 'Contact' page contains a three-field form by which a viewer may contact me by providing a Name, Email, and a Subject (message).
